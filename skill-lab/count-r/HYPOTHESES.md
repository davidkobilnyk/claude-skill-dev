# count-r hypotheses log

Tracks, per new variant: the hypothesis it tests, the change made, and (after the next run) the result and lesson learned.

## Round 1 results summary (v1-v4, 12-case suite)

- v1 (baseline, 278 chars): 7/12. Failed on "hello" (hallucinated an r), "Mirror"/"irregular"/"Rrrrr" (all undercounted double-letter clusters), and the R2D2 stress case (overcounted).
- v2 (char-by-char scan, 650 chars): 9/12. Failed on "hello" (hallucinated) and "Mirror"/"irregular" (undercounted clusters). Fixed the stress case v1 missed.
- v3 (spell-out-then-count, 633 chars): 9/12. Fixed "hello" and "Mirror" (the spelling step eliminated the hallucination). Failed by mis-transcribing "Rrrrr" (wrote 6 chars instead of 5) and "purrrring" (dropped an r), and by miscounting its own correct spelling of "irregular" (said 2 instead of 3).
- v4 (word-by-word tally, 613 chars): 10/12, best of the round. Fixed all cluster-undercount cases (Mirror, irregular, Rrrrr, RRRR) via per-word decomposition. Still failed "hello" (hallucinated) and the plain sentence test (likely an aggregation error summing per-word tallies).

## count-r-v5 (parent: count-r-v4)
Hypothesis: v4's instructions already say to "spell it out" per word, but its failure on "hello" (and the fact that its reported outputs for simple words didn't visibly show the letter-by-letter spelling) suggests that step was being treated as optional/skippable rather than actually performed. Making the spell-out step mandatory and requiring it to appear in the visible output (not just described as an aside) should close that gap without reintroducing v3's cluster-transcription errors, since each word here is spelled in isolation rather than a full sentence.
Change made: reworded the per-word instruction from "spell it out and count" to an explicit mandatory instruction: "you must first write out that word as its individual letters separated by hyphens... before counting anything in it — do not skip this and count from memory."
Result: (fill in after the next run: confirmed / refuted / inconclusive)
Lesson: (fill in after the next run)

## count-r-v6 (parent: count-r-v3)
Hypothesis: v3's two demonstrated failure modes — mis-transcribing a run of repeated letters when spelling out the input (Rrrrr, purrrring), and miscounting its own correct spelling (irregular) — can both be caught by an explicit verification step: checking the spelled-out sequence's length against the original input's length (catches transcription drift), and recounting the r's a second time independently (catches counting slips).
Change made: added one verification paragraph after the existing spell-then-count instructions, requiring a length check and a second independent recount before reporting.
Result: (fill in after the next run: confirmed / refuted / inconclusive)
Lesson: (fill in after the next run)

## count-r-v7 (parent: count-r-v2)
Hypothesis: v2's undercounts on "Mirror" and "irregular" (both containing a double "rr") suggest the running character-by-character count sometimes treats a consecutive repeated letter as a single occurrence rather than counting each one. An explicit warning against collapsing repeated-letter runs, with a concrete example, should fix this without the heavier restructuring of v3/v4.
Change made: inserted one clause into the character-scanning instruction explicitly stating that consecutive r's must each be counted separately, with a worked example ("rr" is 2, not 1).
Result: (fill in after the next run: confirmed / refuted / inconclusive)
Lesson: (fill in after the next run)
